Sphere calculations:

(x - a)² + (y - b)² + (z - c)² = r²
D = normalized oriation vector of the camera
a = D^2 (= 1)
b = 2D(O - C)
c = |O - C|^2 - R2
discr = b * b - 4 * a * c;


Geometry:

Point: xyz coordinate
Homogeneous points: points represented bu 4 numbers
Vector: direction represented bij xyz
Normal: vector perpendicular to the plane tangent P 
		(normals can not be transformed in the same way als vectors)
Unit vectors: a vector with unit length (length 1)

Magnitude or Norm: length of a vector

Translation: moving a point around in space 
			by adding values to the points coordinates 			(P -> Translate -> PT)
Scaling: moving a point by multiplying the points coordinates	(P -> Scale ->PS)
Rotation: rotation of a vector 									(V -> Rotate -> VT)
Normalization: set vector length to 1 							(V-> Normalize ->VN)

Euclidean space: 3D coordinate system where x->axis points to the right, y-axis points up 
	in right-hand system z-axis point backward
	in left-hand system z-axis points forward
We use a right-hand coordinate system??? With up vector being y?

norm: a function that assigns a length or size (or distance) to a vector.
