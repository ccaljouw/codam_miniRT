Sphere calculations:

(x - a)² + (y - b)² + (z - c)² = r²
D = normalized oriation vector of the camera
a = D^2 (= 1)
b = 2D(O - C)
c = |O - C|^2 - R2
discr = b * b - 4 * a * c;


Geometry:

Point: xyz coordinate
Homogeneous points: points represented bu 4 numbers
Vector: direction represented bij xyz
Normal: vector perpendicular to the plane tangent P 
		(normals can not be transformed in the same way als vectors)
Unit vectors: a vector with unit length (length 1)

Magnitude or Norm: length of a vector

Translation: moving a point around in space 
			by adding values to the points coordinates 			(P -> Translate -> PT)
Scaling: moving a point by multiplying the points coordinates	(P -> Scale ->PS)
Rotation: rotation of a vector 									(V -> Rotate -> VT)
Normalization: set vector length to 1 							(V-> Normalize ->VN)

Euclidean space: 3D coordinate system where x->axis points to the right, y-axis points up 
	in right-hand system z-axis point backward
	in left-hand system z-axis points forward
We use a right-hand coordinate system??? With up vector being y?

norm: a function that assigns a length or size (or distance) to a vector.

Camera:
aperture: pinhole
canvas: back face of the camera on which the image is projected
focal length: distance between pinhole and image plane
		> smaller fov (zoom in)
		< wider fov (zoom out)
apex : Having selected one side of a triangle to be the base (image plane), 
	   the opposite vertex (point in of the triangle) to that base is called the apex
fov: angle of the apex. The field of view can be defined as the angle of the triangle 
	in the horizontal or vertical plane of the camera. The horizontal field of view 
	varies with the width of the image plane, and the vertical field of view varies 
	with the height of the image plane.
Image aspect ratio = width / height
Near and far clipping plane: Objects closer than the near-clipping
	plane and farther than the far-clipping plane are invisible to 
	the camera. (needed for rasterization to work)
Viewing frustum: the space between the near an far clipping planes
Point of convergence: camera origin

Each pixel in an imag corresponds to a singular light ray R with a ginven direction D and a given origin O.
