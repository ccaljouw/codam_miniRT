CREATE BRANCH:

1. Create a new branch off main using 
	git branch <new_branch> 
2. Once created you can then use 
	git checkout <new_branch> 
to switch to that branch (Use git status to check that you are now on the new branch).

3. First time pushing new commits:
	git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch>

MERGING TESTED WORK TO MAIN:
1. merge master into working branch
	use 
		git fetch --all 
	to make sure you get the latest status on your local system
	make sure you are on the working branch (check with git status)
	use
		git merge main --no-commit
2. fix merge conflicts (easy when using vscode..).
3. commit and push changes on the working branch.
4. merge working branch into master
		git checkout main
		git pull (to be absolutely sure u have the latest version)
		git merge <working branch>
		git push
	this should not provide any merge conflicts.
