Create your own branch to work on:
Git checkout works hand-in-hand with git branch. The git branch command can be used to create a new branch. 
When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using 
		git main <new_branch> 
Once created you can then use 
		git checkout <new_branch> 
to switch to that branch.
